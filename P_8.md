# Exercise 6: Create A Database Migration Task


An AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) task is where all the work happens. You use tasks to migrate data from the source endpoint to the target endpoint, and the task processing is done on the replication instance. You specify what tables and schemas to use for your migration and any special processing, such as logging requirements, control table data, and error handling.

Follow the below steps to create Database migration tasks.

1. In the left navigation pane, choose Database migration tasks and click on the **Create task**.
