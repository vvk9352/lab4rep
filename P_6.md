# Exercise 4: Create Your Source Endpoint

In this exercise, you will be creating a source endpoint. An endpoint provides connection, data store type, and location information about your data store. The AWS Database Migration Service uses this information to connect to a data store and migrate data from a source endpoint to a target endpoint. You can specify additional connection attributes for an endpoint by using extra connection attributes. These attributes can control logging, file size, and other parameters; for more information about extra connection attributes, see the documentation section for your data store.

Follow the below steps to configure the source endpoint:

1. On the AWS DMS page, open the navigation page on the left, click on the **Endpoints (1)**, and **Create endpoints (2).**
